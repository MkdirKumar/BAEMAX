#### Description:

BaeMAX is a website for those who at times does feel so well mentally, maybe due to some personal issue or something. This website help these people to cope with there sad mood or may help them during their anxiety. 
I have tried to add almost those things which can make the mood lite from all those sadness and dull thoughts. For that I have made few sections namely : Book, Feel Good and gallery.

#### Book -
As we all know reading good book can give us such a great impact on our lives, Hence in 
this ection I have shared some of the bestest books I have came across till now. 

#### Feel Good -

Music is something we all need in every phase of live, music is the taste of life. Hence in my next section i.e. Feel Good I have listed some of the greatest artists of all time to uplift your mood and maybe make you groove with their beats.

#### Gallery -

Gallery is a section where you can some of the greatest quotes given by some of our most favorite movie characters for example Dumbledore, Mater(cars), nick(zootopia), Baymax(Big Heroes six) and many more. Because some times words can do miracles and as we all know that "Happiness can be found in the darkest of time, if one remembers to turn on the lights"-Dumbledore.

#### features -
1) Using css i have given the website to adapte the screen size according to its need. For example if the website is open in mobile, the navbar will be shifted to a menu bar(dedicated button) on the left top corner and the moment you resize the brower using the cursor it will resize accordingly.
2) added a dedicated search bar with drop down button.
3) using html and css, i have tried to make a login/logout screen (but haven't added the ability to log-in yet)
